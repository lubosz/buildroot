		SDL_gpu, a library for making hardware-accelerated 2D graphics easy. by Jonathan Dearborn
		SDL_gpu is licensed under the terms of the MIT License. See LICENSE.txt for details of the usage license granted to you for this code.
		High performance (it automatically collects and submits batches instead of separate draw commands for each sprite and redundant state changes)
		Shader API
		Arbitrary geometry rendering (triangles)
		Can be integrated with explicit OpenGL calls (mixed 2D and 3D)
		Full blend state control
		Built-in primitive shapes (points, lines, tris, rects, ellipses, polygons, even arcs)
		Uses a style familiar to SDL 1.2 users
		Compatible with either SDL 1.2 or 2.0
		Loads BMP, TGA, and PNG files via stb-image
		Rotates and scales about the center of images, making reasoning about the resulting corner coordinates more obvious (adjustable via anchor settings)
